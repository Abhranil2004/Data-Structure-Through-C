# Data Structure Through C

Welcome to the "Data Structure Through C" repository! This project provides implementations and examples of various data structures using the C programming language. It's aimed at helping you understand and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms in C.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each containing code related to different data structures:

- `arrays/`: Implementation and examples of array data structures.
- `linked_lists/`: Implementation and examples of singly and doubly linked lists.
- `stacks/`: Implementation of stack data structures.
- `queues/`: Implementation of queue data structures.
- `trees/`: Implementation of tree data structures, including binary trees and binary search trees.
- `graphs/`: Implementation of graph data structures and algorithms.
- `hash_tables/`: Implementation of hash tables and hash functions.
- `sorting_algorithms/`: Implementation of various sorting algorithms.
- `searching_algorithms/`: Implementation of various searching algorithms.
