# Data Structure Through C

Welcome to the "Data Structure Through C" repository! This project provides implementations and examples of various data structures using the C programming language. It's aimed at helping you understand and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms in C.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each containing code related to different data structures:

- `Arrayspointers/`: Implementation and examples of arrays and pointers.
- `Graph/`: Implementation of graph data structures and algorithms.
- `Introduction/`: Introductory materials and basic examples related to data structures.
- `Searching/`: Implementation of various searching algorithms.
- `Sorting/`: Implementation of various sorting algorithms.
- `Stack and Queue/`: Implementation of stack and queue data structures.
- `Trees/`: Implementation of tree data structures, including binary trees and binary search trees.
